Positive Test Cases:-

Check for the parentheses
check for the regular expression
Check for root directory exists
Check for dictionary containing values


Negative test cases:
a) Leave a parentheses and check for error

b) Enter a wrong regular expression and check for error 
1. Unterminated Regular Expression
2. Starts with a digit
3. Start with illegal character
4. Illegal Escape Sequence


c) Enter the wrong path manually ( absolute path)
d) check for imports used incorrectly
 import pyplot as plt but use as pyplot in code for error

e) Illegal use of variable
define a variable but use a variable with a different name

f) Make sure the dictionary contains more than 128 entries in which case Matplotlib wonâ€™t work. 


Logical Test:
1. Put os.path.basename[dirpath] instead of dirpath which gives only name of directory and not the path as mentioned 
2. Initialise count variable inside second loop which will keep on increasing the value of count for every directory and give incorrect results.
